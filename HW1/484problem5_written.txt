Q5.1

With the given data set, it seems that the Diabetes Pedigree Function had
the highest impact on the outcome. We assume this because the DBF had the
highest weight out of every feature after LogisticRegression training.

Q5.2

We noticed that after LogisticRegression training the 'X' feature ended with
the same weight as the 'Glucose' feature. We believe that we obtain similar
predicted values because the sum of the Glucose weight and the X weight is
similar to the Glucose weight in test 5.1.

Q5.3

When comparing test 5.3 to test 5.2, the weights were more similar than
between test 5.1 and 5.2.
